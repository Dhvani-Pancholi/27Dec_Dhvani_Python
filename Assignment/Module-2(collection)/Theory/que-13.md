##### Introduction to dictionaries: key-value pairs

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

Example:
```python
dict = {
  "name": "Dhvani",
  "age": "22",
  "dob": "7 dec"
}
print(dict)
```
