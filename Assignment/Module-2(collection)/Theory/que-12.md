#####  Slicing a tuple to access ranges of elements.

Slicing a tuple in Python allows you to access a specific range of elements from a tuple. Slicing is done using the syntax:

```python
tuple[start:stop:step]
```
where:
- start: The index to begin the slice (inclusive).
- stop: The index to end the slice (exclusive).
- step: The interval between elements (optional).

```python
tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
print(tuple[1:])
print(tuple[:7])
print(tuple[3:8:2])
print(tuple[-3:])
