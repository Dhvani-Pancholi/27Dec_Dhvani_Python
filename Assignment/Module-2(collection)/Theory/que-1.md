#####  Understanding how to create and access elements in a list.

**Creating a List**

A list in Python is created using square brackets []. Elements in a list can be of any data type (e.g., integers, strings, floats, or even other lists).

```python
numbers = [1, "mango", 33.3, True] 
```

**Accessing element in a list**

You can access elements in a list using their index

```python
numbers = [1, "mango", 33.3, True] 
print(numbers[2])
```
