##### Accessing tuple elements using positive and negative indexing

Indexing in Python tuples allows you to access specific elements based on their position. 

**Positive Indexing**

- Starts from 0 for the first element.
- Increments by 1 for each subsequent element.

```python
tuple = ("c","c++","python","android","java","php")
print(tuple[0]) 
```
**Negative Indexing**
- Starts from -1 for the last element.
- Decrements by 1 for each preceding element.

```python
tuple = ("c","c++","python","android","java","php")
print(tuple[-1])
```
