#####  Introduction to tuples, immutability

Python Tuple is a collection of objects separated by commas.

A tuple is similar to a Python list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but the main difference between both is Python tuple is immutable and list is mutable.

```python
tuple = (1,2,3,4)
print(tuple)
```

Like Lists, tuples are ordered and we can access their elements using their index values.

We cannot update items to a tuple once it is created. 

Tuples cannot be appended or extended.

We cannot remove items from a tuple once it is created.
