##### Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing)

Indexing in Python lists allows you to access specific elements based on their position. 

**Positive Indexing**

- Starts from 0 for the first element.
- Increments by 1 for each subsequent element.

```python
list = ["c","c++","python","android","java","php"]
print(list[0]) 
```
**Negative Indexing**
- Starts from -1 for the last element.
- Decrements by 1 for each preceding element.

```python
list = ["c","c++","python","android","java","php"]
print(list[-1])
```
