##### Basic operations with tuples: concatenation, repetition, membership.

**1.Concatenation**
Combines two or more tuples into one.

Example:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
result = tup1 + tup2
print(result)
```
**2.Repetition**
Repeats the elements of a tuple multiple times.

Example:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
result = tup1 * 3
print(result)
```

**3.Membership**
Checks if an element exists in a tuple.

Example:
```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
if 2 in tup1:
    print("yes")
else:
    print("no")
```
