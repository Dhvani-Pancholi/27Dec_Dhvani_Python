###### Indentation, comments, and naming conventions in Python.

<b>Indentation </b>: Most preferred indentation method in Python is space, which is a standard convention and even official Python Style Guide recommends using 4 spaces for every indentation level. 

<b>Naming Convention</b> : Python offers various naming styles, such as lowercase, lowercase with underscores, CamelCase, and ALL_CAPS.

<b>Comments</b> : In Python, comments are lines of text in a program that are ignored by the interpreter. They are used to provide explanations about the code and can help understand the code or for remembering the purpose of certain lines of code.
