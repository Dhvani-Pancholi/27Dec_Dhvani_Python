##### String slicing :

Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

```python
s = "Dhvani Pancholi"
print(s[2:6])
```
##### Slice From the Start :
By leaving out the start index, the range will start at the first character:
```python
s = "Dhvani Pancholi"
print(s[:6])
```

##### Slice to the End :
By leaving out the end index, the range will go to the end of the string:
```python
s = "Dhvani Pancholi"
print(s[0:])
```
