##### How functional programming works in Python

Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in a pure mathematical functions style. 

It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on what to solve in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is how to solve. 

It uses expressions instead of statements. An expression is evaluated to produce a value whereas a statement is executed to assign variables.

**Concepts of Functional Programming**

**Pure Functions:** These functions have two main properties. First, they always produce the same output for the same arguments irrespective of anything else. Secondly, they have no side-effects i.e. they do modify any argument or global variables or output something.

**Recursion:** There are no “for” or “while” loop in functional languages. Iteration in functional languages is implemented through recursion.

**Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order:** First-class functions are treated as first-class variables. The first-class variables can be passed to functions as a parameter, can be returned from functions, or stored in data structures.

**Variables are Immutable:** In functional programming, we can’t modify a variable after it’s been initialized. We can create new variables – but we can’t modify existing variables.
