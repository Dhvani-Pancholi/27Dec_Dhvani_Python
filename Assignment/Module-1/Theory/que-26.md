##### Basic operations: concatenation, repetition, string methods (upper(), lower(), etc.)

**1.Concatenation :**
Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings into one. It is done using the + operator.

```python

s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"
result = s1 + " " + s2  
print(result)  
```

**2.Repetition :**
Repetition is the process of repeating a string a specified number of times. It is done using theoperator.

```python
s = "Hello"
result = s * 3
print(result)
```
**3.String Methods :**
String methods are functions that can be applied to strings to perform various operations. Some common string methods include :


text = "hello Python!"

**Convert to lowercase**
print(text.lower())  

**Convert to uppercase**
print(text.upper())

**Replace a substring**
print(text.replace("Python","World"))

**Converts the first character to upper case**
print(text.capitalize())
