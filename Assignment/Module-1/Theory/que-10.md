##### Python variables and memory allocation

1.Variables in Python

A variable in Python is essentially a name that points to an object stored in memory.

```python
a = 10 # here a is variable
```

2.Objects and Memory Allocation
- Everything in Python is an object, including integers, strings, lists, and functions.
- When you assign a value to a variable, Python creates an object in memory to represent the value.

- Each object has:
<b>Type:</b> Defined by its class (e.g., int, str, list).
<b>Value:</b> The data stored in the object.
<b>Reference count:</b> The number of references to the object (used for memory management).
