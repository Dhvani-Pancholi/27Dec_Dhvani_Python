##### Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are a fundamental concept in programming and are used extensively in various programming languages.

##### if Statement :
The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. The general syntax of the if statement is as follows:

###### syntax:
```python
if condition:
# code to be executed if condition is true
```

##### else Statement:
The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false
The general syntax of the else statement is as follows:

###### syntax:
```python
if condition:
    #Code to execute if the condition is True
else:
    #Code to execute if the condition is False
```
##### elif Statement:
The elif statement is used to check another condition if the initial condition in the if statement is false.
The general syntax of the elif statement is as follows:
###### syntax:
```python
if condition1:
    #Code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    #Code to execute if condition2 is True
