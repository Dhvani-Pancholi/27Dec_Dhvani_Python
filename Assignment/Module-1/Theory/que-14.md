##### Introduction to for and while loops

1.for Loop
- The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

Syntax:
```python
for variable in sequence:
    # code to execute
```

Using range() in a for loop
- The range() function generates a sequence of numbers.

```python

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```

2.while Loop
- The while loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a given condition is True. If the condition becomes False, the loop stops.

Syntax:
```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute
```
