##### Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.)

**1.Loops with Lists**
A list is an ordered and mutable collection.

Example :

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**2.Loops with Tuples**
A tuple is an ordered but immutable collection.

Example :

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```   

**3.Loops with Sets**
A set is an unordered and mutable collection.

Example :

```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4}
for number in unique_numbers:
    print(number)
```

**4.Loops with Dictionaries**
A dictionary is an unordered and mutable collection of key-value pairs.

Example :

```python
person = {"name": "Dhvani", "age": 22, "city": "Rajkot"}
for key in person:
    print(key)
```
