##### Understanding how generators work in Python.

In Python, generators are special functions that allow you to iterate over a sequence of items, generating them lazily on-the-fly rather than storing them in memory all at once.

They are defined using a syntax similar to regular functions but use yield statements instead of return.

##### Key points about generators:

**Lazy Evaluation:** Values are generated one at a time, as needed, which can save memory when dealing with large datasets.

**Iterable:** Generators can be iterated over using a loop or by calling next() explicitly.

**State Retention:** Unlike functions that return and terminate, generators retain their state between calls, allowing them to resume where they left of
