##### Introduction to closures and decorators.

**Closures in Python**
A closure in Python occurs when a nested function captures the local variables from its enclosing scope. 
This allows the nested function to access these variables even after the outer function has finished executing.

###### How Closures Work

Closures are created when:

- There is a nested function.
- The nested function references a value in its enclosing scope.
- The enclosing function returns the nested function.

**Decorators in Python**
Python Decorators are a powerful and expressive tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or method.
 They are often used to add "wrapping" functionality to existing functions in a clean and readable way.

###### How Decorators Work
A decorator is a function that takes another function as an argument, adds some kind of functionality, and returns a new function.
